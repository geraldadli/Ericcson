# 🌾 IoT Agriculture

## 📘 Overview

This project integrates IoT sensors with machine learning to automate smart farming tasks like irrigation control and nutrient prediction.

## 🗂 Structure

```
IoT-Agriculture/
├── Code/        # Training and inference scripts
├── Model/       # Saved .pkl models for IoT backend
└── Dataset/     # Kaggle datasets used for training
```

## 🤖 Models

1. **DecisionTreeSmartIrrigation.pkl**
   Predicts whether **Fan**, **Water Pump**, or **Actuator** should turn ON/OFF based on **7-in-1 soil sensor** data.

2. **nutrient_sensor_model.pkl**
   Predicts nutrient gaps (**B, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, N, P, S, Zn**) from **pH, Moisture, Temperature, and EC**.

3. *(Optional)* **Image Recognition Model**
   Detects plant diseases from images. Will be shared via **Google Drive** if needed.

## ⚙️ Integration

The `.pkl` models can be loaded into any IoT backend (e.g., Flask API, Raspberry Pi) for real-time predictions:

```
Sensor → Backend Model → Decision → Actuator/Fan/Pump/Nutrient
```
